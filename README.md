# rock-paper-scissors

It's a simple game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this game there are two options, Play-with-Bot or Player-with-Player. You can Play-with-Bot whereas the bot plays random while with Player-with-Player you can challenge your friends, enemies, your parents, or your dog.

## Mechanics of the game

The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
