               <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
               <p>The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors.</p>
               <br />
               <p>
                  The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended
                  toward the opposing player.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p>
                  Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there
                  is a clear winner.
